# llms-evaluation-msbi
A Microsoft Business Intelligence (MSBI) solution for evaluating and benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) using real-world benchmark data. This project implements a complete BI pipeline with SSIS (ETL), SSAS (OLAP Cube), and Power BI visualizations to centralize, structure, and analyze the performance of open-source LLMs.

## 1. Project Overview
The project addresses the challenge of evaluating and benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) by centralizing, structuring, and analyzing their performance data. Evaluation results are currently scattered across CSV files, model cards, and scientific articles, making comparison and analysis difficult. The solution involves building a dedicated Data Warehouse, automating ETL processes, and enabling multidimensional analysis and visualization using Microsoft BI tools (SSIS, SSAS, Power BI). The project enables standardized, reproducible, and dynamic analysis of LLM performance across various benchmarks and dimensions.
